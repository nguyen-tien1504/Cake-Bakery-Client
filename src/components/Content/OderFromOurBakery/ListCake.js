Hand peeled and sliced fresh apples are tossed in cinnamon, sugar, orange zest, European butter, vanilla bean and a touch of Brandy.  The mound of apples is then filled into Gwendolyn's signature all-butter pie crust, topped with cinnamon butter crumble and baked on low heat for over two hours making the apples soft and the crumble crisp. When the pie comes out of the oven it is over 6 high and will be the best Apple Crumble Pie you have ever had. ",

Crushed chocolate wafer cookies and melted Callebaut Belgian chocolate are mixed together, creating a deep chocolatey pie crust. Filled with a mixture of heavy cream, peanut butter, and a touch of cream cheese. It tastes like a Peanut Butter Cheesecake, melted Callebaut Belgian chocolate ganache is poured over the top with roasted chopped peanuts. Delicious!. This dessert must be kept refrigerated.",
